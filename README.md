## Introduction
### FirstPerson Shooting Game : ­°§¯°£Å]
 Hello, welcome to My First 3D FPS Game.
 
 This game is about a park full of ghosts that suddenly appears, and the nearby residents  invited a chineses priest to sealed those ghosts. 
 
 The design of the ghosts is inspired by my group experience at school.
 There are a lot of nasty people who are greedy, lazy, and complaning just like ghosts around my college life.
